## Lyrics

```
all these nights in the low
i got nothing in my soul
breaking habits for a cause
keep on tricking, still alone

fall is near i can tell
what you truly wanted gone
is already out and bare

i won't stand for stagnation

all these nights in the low
i got nothing in my soul
breaking habits for a cause
keep on tricking, still alone

fall is near i can tell
what you truly wanted gone
is already out and bare

what i want is your patience

i had nothing on the plot
in 



```
