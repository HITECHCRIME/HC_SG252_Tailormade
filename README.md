## Lyrics

```
all these nights in the low
i got nothing in my soul
breaking habits for a cause
keep on tricking, still alone

fall is near i can tell
what you truly wanted gone
is already out and bare
i won't stand for stagnation

all these nights in the low
i got nothing in my soul
breaking habits for a cause
keep on tricking, still alone

fall is near i can tell
what you truly wanted gone
is already out and bare
what i want is your patience

you got nothing on the plot that's tough
doing motions on concotions mixed with rot
self is gone, 

your own enemy - vanished into clouds 


```
